Lightgrid
=========
Version 1.0.1

A simple no-brainer fluid css grid system to use in your project.
It's aim is to remove the clutter and provide a simple but fluid grid.
This grid borrows heavily from 1140px grid system by andy taylor and boostrap framework's grid system.

It is designed to be as small as possible. It is made to be integrated in your projects.

Lightgrid uses a 12 column grid. To create a simple layout, create a .row and name classnames as col-1, col-2, etc inside it.
Don't forget to add the .last class in your last div.

You can also offset a div to leave space on the left side. To do that, use 'offset-yourValue' as a class name.
Eg: div class='col-6 offset-2'
